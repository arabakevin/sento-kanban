# Sento Kanban

The Sento application stack includes differents components with one of them being
this Kanban view. Sento tries to free up as much as possible the code in order to
allows others to use it, avoid reinventing the wheel, and ideally have
contributions from the open source community.

Here is screenshot of the actual state:
